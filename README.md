# Visual Pathfinder
A simple application that visualizes the A* path finding algorithm.

## Requirements
- pygame
- tkinter

## How to run
```
python src/main.py
```
Once running, enter start and end coordinates for the algorithm. These values by default are between 0 and 40. You can then draw obstacles which must be searched around. Once all obstacles are placed, press <kbd>Return</kbd> to begin the algorithm.

The program will then show the path which the algorithm takes to find the shortest path from the source node to the end node.
